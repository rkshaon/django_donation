      <p class="card-text">Bangladesh is a very underdeveloped country. The residents of the country suffer from very poor living conditions and vulnerability to elements like natural disasters and disease outbreaks. These problems are more evident in the rural areas where urbanization is still far away. Now one of the most persecuted minorities of the world is suffering from these issues on an unimaginable scale. These are people that have been unjustly discriminated against and these are people that have faced life threatening violence in their own motherland. These are people that had no one to protect them from the atrocities being committed. These people are the Rohingya's from Myanmar who have now fled to Bangladesh where they have come in hopes of finding a haven where they can live their lives just like we do. And we see that there are lot of organization who are trying to help them but the can not collect enough fund. On the other hand we see that many people who want to donate but but because  of the busy schedule of our daily life they can't do that.</p>
